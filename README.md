# Ziad's dotfiles

To Get My Config
----------------

Add this command to your bashrc/zshrc

	source ~/dotfiles/ziadrc


For My First Run Setup
----------------------
On ubuntu

	ubuntu_setup

On mac (NOT TESTED)

	mac_setup

I maintain these to be my own dotfiles, but I recognize that other people 
may want to use them. If you have any recomendations, I can't gurantee that 
I'll incorporate them, but I'd love to hear them. 

Feel free to fork and pull request any additions you have.
